# M17 Amateur Radio Club

We're making official (in the eyes of the FCC so we can request a club
callsign) the meetings we've been having for some time in 2022.

## Important dates
In person meeting on March 26th (Sunday) at the [CVRC
flea](https://k1bke.wordpress.com/2023/02/05/cvrc-2023-flea-market/)
in Henniker. Dinner afterwards, probably in Concord.

### Agenda[0]: Creation of the club

We must have a quorum of at least four people to continue.

Today:

* Must take meeting minutes. Store them here under 'minutes.md' next to this file.
* Draft/amend proposed documents from KC1AWV, including statement of
intent, constitution, bylaws as appropriate
* Elect officers
* Take roll call and generate a roster of members
* Select a license trustee for requesting a club call


Done:

* FRN registration.


Future:

* Submit signed documents and 605-C to a [VEC](https://www.w5yi-vec.org/index.php/club-station-licenses).
* (after callsign received): Apply for a vanity callsign via FCC.

### Agenda[1]: Local repeaters

We want to outreach with local clubs to investigate what is needed to
enable M17 on local repeaters. In many cases this will just require a
new repeater controller. Off-internet linking is desirable.

### Agenda[2]: Ready demonstrations

Survey and pooling of known-good M17 demonstrations. Repeater-on-a-board,
modded MD-UV380s, MMDVM hotspots and M17Clients, etc. This is to further
the "Local repeaters" issue.
